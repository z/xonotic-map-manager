.. Xonotic Map Manager Intro

Intro
=====

Xonotic Map Manager is the command-line package manager component of the `xonotic-map-repository`_ project. Whether you're a server admin looking to manage map lists, or a player trying to learn more about their map collection, ``xmm`` is a tool to help you do this quickly and efficiently.


Use it like ``apt``::

    xmm update
    xmm install eggandscrambled.pk3
    xmm list

If you get stuck, try using a ``xmm -h``, or reference the Usage page.

By default, the unofficial, general purpose Xonotic map repository, `xonotic.co`_, is enabled. Advanced users can add additional repositories and/or host their own.
